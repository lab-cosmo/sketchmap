   <h2>Analyzing the results</h2>
      <p>
      Unless you are working for a model system for which you know already which kind of embedding
      to expect, it is not straightforward to judge the success of the fitting procedure. There are
      many ways to post-process the projected points to get some qualitative -- and quantitative -- 
      assessment of the outcome of the fit. <br/>
      A first possibility is to color the projected points according to different coordinates of the 
      corresponding high-dimensional samples: if the fitting was successful one would expect points
      of similar color to be clustered together, rather than mixed up with points of different color. 
      </p>         
      <p>
      Another, more quantitative, analysis can be performed using the <span class="code">dimdist</span>
      utility. With the appropriate parameters, <span class="code">dimdist</span> generates a D-d plot,
      i.e. an histogram which measures the probability that, for any high-dimensional pairwise distance D,
      the distance between the corresponding projections will be d. A completely faithful embedding would 
      preserve the distances, so the D-d histogram should be a series of delta function along the D=d diagonal.
      Having performed sketch-map, instead, one expects would already be content when the majority of the 
      density is concentrated in the D&lt;&sigma;,d&lt;&sigma; and D&gt;&sigma;,d&gt;&sigma; regions.

      Note that both the high-dim and low-dim data set must be provided, in files containing
      one point per line, without headers. Optionally, the high-dimension file may contain

         Mixed metric MDS/sketch-map embedding, with mixing parameter going from pure MDS to pure sketch-map.
         The embedding (coloured according to one of the dihedrals) is shown side by side with the corresponding
         D-d plot. Note how metric MDS tends to have high density in the D&gt;&sigma;,d&lt;&sigma;. This means that
         "far" points are mapped to "close" points in low-dimension: this is detrimental if the mapping is to 
         be used to classify configurations, to compute free energies or perform enhanced sampling.
         Sketch-map, on the other hand, manages to keep most of the density in the "good" regions: even though
         the structure of the data set is deformed, most of the topological relations that matter
         have been preserved.

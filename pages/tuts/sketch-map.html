   <h2> Running sketch-map </h2>
   
   <p>
      Having determined some reasonable parameters which define 
      "proximity" for the data set we want to project, we are now
      ready to run sketch-map. The minimization procedure can be quite 
      time-consuming, in particular if one is using many landmarks 
      and/or very high dimensionality. The optimization is fully automated
      using the shell script <span class="code">sketch-map.sh</span>,
      which interactively asks the parameters to perform the minimization.
   </p>

   <div class="body" id="tut-script" style="display: block;">
      <p>
        First, make sure that the <span class="code">SMAPROOT</span> variable 
        defined inside <span class="code">sketch-map.sh</span> actually points 
        to where the sketch-map executables are stored. Then, it suffices to run
      </p>
      <div class="code" >
         ./sketch-map.sh
      </div>
      <p>
        and input the various options as they are required. <br/>
        For instance, to run the kind of sketch-map optimization which is described in details 
        below, the interactive session would look like
      </p>
      <div class="code" >
Please enter the dimensionality of input data 24 <br/>
Are points weighted [y/n]? y <br/>
Please enter the periodicity of input data [0 if non-periodic] 6.2831853 <br/>
Please enter the input data file name highd-landmarks <br/>
Please enter the output data prefix lowd <br/>
Please enter high dimension sigma, a, b [e.g. 6.0 2 6 ] 6 12 12 <br/>
Please enter low  dimension sigma, a, b [e.g. 6.0 2 6 ] 6 1 2 <br/>
      </div>
      <p>
        The script will then proceed to produce many intermediate optimization steps. Read
        below if you are interested into the details, otherwise just find the final optimization 
        result into <span class="code">&lt;prefix&gt;.gmds</span>. The sketch-map 
        coordinates of the landmarks are in the first two columns.

   <h2> A detailed description of the process </h2>
   
   In order to better understand the inner workings of the minimization, we will
   discuss in some length how to manually perform the steps which are automated
   by the sketch-map script.

   <h3> Getting a starting map: running linear MDS </h3>
   <p>
      Sketch-map owes its flexibility to the fact of using an iterative minimization
      of a strongly non-linear fitness function. The downside is that it is exposed
      to the risk of getting stuck in a poor local minimum, which doesn't preserve
      as well as possible the proximity relations found in the high-dimensional data. 
      In order to generate a reasonable starting configuration for the low-dimensional
      projections, we perform linear MDS by running <span class="code">dimred</span>
      without any iterative minimization parameters. 
   </p>
   <p style="font-style:italic;"> 
      Images show the two-dimensional embedding at different stages of 
      the optimization (here after the initial linear MDS projection). 
      Dots have areas proportional to the weight of the corresponding landmark, and 
      are colored according to the value of one of the dihedrals
      (so points of different colors should be projected far apart). 
   </p>

      <p>
         You can get a linear MDS (PCA if the distance is Euclidean with no periodicity) 
         by just running <span class="code">dimred</span> without iterative minimization options
      </p>
      <div class="code" >
         grep -v \# highd-landmarks |  dimred -D 24 -pi 6.283185 -d 2 -w -center > lowd-mds
      </div>
      <p>
         Note that  <span class="code">dimred</span> expects on standard input the sequence of the 
         landmarks given as 
      </p>
      <div class="code">
        x<sub>1</sub>(1) x<sub>2</sub>(1) .... x<sub>D</sub>(1)  [w(1)]<br/>
        x<sub>1</sub>(2) x<sub>2</sub>(2) .... x<sub>D</sub>(2)  [w(1)]<br/>        
        ....
      </div>         
      <p>
         In this case we specify the <span class="code">-w</span> option, so the weights must be present
         as the last entry on each line. Note that for MDS weights are ignored, but we keep them in the file 
         as will be used for later steps. Comments lines which may be present in the landmark file should be 
         deleted or filtered out as we are doing here.<br/>
         The output will contain a just a list of the low-dimensional projections. If options are specified
         which make the output more verbose, a header or some additional columns may be present as well.

   <h3> Iterative metric MDS and pointwise-global optimization </h3>
      <p>      
         Conventional MDS is not really trying to match pairwise distances in high dimension to low-dimension,
         minimizing --write here chi2_id--. It is trying to do so <em>with the constraint of the embedding
         being a linear projection</em>. This additional assumption makes the problem solvable with spectral
         methods, but means that the projected distances won't match the original ones as well as they could. 
         On the other hand, iterative minimization of the stress function is prone to getting stuck in local
         minima. To partially circumvent this problem, <span class="code">dimred</span> allows one to
         perform a <em>pointwise-global</em> optimization. This means that one the program tries to find the 
         global minimum of the stress for one point at a time, keeping the others fixed, and performing
         local conjugate-gradient steps whenever one projection is moved from its initial location. 
         This global optimization is performed by grid search: the stress is computed on a coarse grid as
         a function of the coordinates of the projected point. Then an interpolation is built on a finer 
         grid, and one sees if there exists a node in the fine grid with lower stress than the current one.

         Here <span class="code">-grid gw,g1,g2</span> specifies the extent of the grid (which runs from -gw to gw in all directions),
         the number of points in the coarse grid g1 and the number of points in the fine grid g2. <span class="code">-preopt</span>
         indicates the number of conjugate-gradient steps to be performed before starting the pointwise-global procedure
         and <span class="code">-gopt</span> the number of CG steps after each successful global move.
         <span class="code">-init</span> specify a file with the initial embedding positions, which should just contain the

   <p>
      While the resulting embedding is still far from perfect, one can see how points with similar dihedrals start
      clustering together, even though there is still considerable overlap and regions where all the values are
      mixed up.

   <h3> Finally - sketch-map </h3>
   <p>
      In simpler cases, it is now possible to just run again <span class="code">dimred</span>, starting from the 
      metric MDS embedding, and perform sketch-map with the chosen parameters. In complex cases such as this one, where
      the sketch-map embedding is very different (and much more informative!) than the metric MDS one, doing
      sketch-map optimization directly may lead to a poor optimization -- just because the  very bad initial configuration.
      In this case, it can prove very effective to perform a <em>simulated annealing</em> procedure in which 
      the stress function of a metric MDS and that of sketch-map with the chosen parameters are mixed together,
      and successive optimizations are performed with a decreasing fraction of the metric MDS stress.
